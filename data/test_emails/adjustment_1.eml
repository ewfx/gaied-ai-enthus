Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

I am writing to formally request a modification to my loan agreement [Account #123456789] with ABC Bank, which was initiated on January 12, 2020. Due to recent financial challenges, I am experiencing difficulties in maintaining the current payment schedule and would like to discuss potential modifications to the loan terms.

I kindly request your consideration of the following alternatives:

1. Extended Repayment Period: An elongation of the loan duration to alleviate monthly payment pressure.
2. Modified Payment Schedule: A temporary reduction in monthly installments for a period of 10 months, followed by resumption of standard payments.
3. Interest Rate Review: A potential reassessment of the current interest rate to better accommodate my financial situation.

I remain fully committed to meeting my financial obligations and am prepared to submit any required documentation to support this application. Please advise on the necessary procedures, associated fees, and any additional information required for evaluation.

I look forward to your response. You can reach me at +123456789 or john.doe@sdfj.com.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
John Doe
