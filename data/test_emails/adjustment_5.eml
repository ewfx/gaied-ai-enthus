Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

RE: URGENT - Loan Modification Request
Account Number: 123456789
Original Issue Date: January 12, 2020

I am writing to urgently request a modification to my loan terms with ABC Bank. Due to unexpected financial difficulties, I am currently unable to maintain my current payment schedule and need immediate assistance in adjusting the loan structure.

I am requesting consideration for the following options:

1. EXTENDED LOAN TERM
   - To reduce monthly payment pressure
   - Willing to discuss various term options

2. TEMPORARY EMI REDUCTION
   - 10-month reduced payment period
   - Full payment resumption afterward

3. INTEREST RATE REVIEW
   - Request for rate reassessment
   - To better accommodate current financial situation

I am fully committed to meeting all financial obligations and can provide immediate documentation support. Please advise on:
- Required procedures
- Associated fees
- Additional documentation needed

Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
John Doe
