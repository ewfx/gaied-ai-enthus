Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

I hope you are doing well. I am writing on behalf of *XYZ Industries Pvt.
Ltd.*, an existing corporate customer with *ABC Bank*, regarding our loan
account *[987654321]*, which was originally secured for investment in our
company=E2=80=99s expansion.

As part of our ongoing financial strategy, we would like to explore the
possibility of modifying our loan commitment terms. Additionally, we are
interested in understanding the *cashless roll option* and whether it can
be applied to our existing loan structure. Specifically, we would like
clarity on:

   1.

   *Process and requirements* for modifying the existing loan commitment.
   2.

   *Eligibility and terms* associated with the cashless roll option.
   3.

   Any *documentation or approvals* necessary for these changes.

We appreciate your guidance on the available options and the next steps to
proceed with this request. Please share the relevant details at your
earliest convenience. If needed, we are happy to schedule a discussion to
review the implications further.

Looking forward to your response. You can reach me at *+91 98765 43210* or
via email at *finance@xyzindustries.com*.

Best regards,
*Rahul Mehta*
