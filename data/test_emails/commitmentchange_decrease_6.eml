Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

I hope you're having a good day. I'm writing about our loan account (#678901234) with ABC Bank. As a long-time customer, TechVision Solutions Ltd. is looking to reduce our loan commitment and close the loan earlier than planned.

Here's what we need to know:

• What documents do we need to prepare for reducing the loan tenure?
• How long will the process take?
• What are the costs involved?
• What are the terms for early closure?
• What approvals do we need?

For any questions or to discuss this further, please don't hesitate to reach out to:

Rachel Wong

Thanks so much for your help with this!

Best regards,
