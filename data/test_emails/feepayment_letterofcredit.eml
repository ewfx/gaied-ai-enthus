I hope you are doing well. I am reaching out on behalf of *XYZ Industries
Pvt. Ltd.*, an existing corporate customer with *ABC Bank*, regarding our
loan account *[987654321]*.

As part of our financial operations, we are considering utilizing a *Letter
of Credit (LC)* facility under our existing loan arrangement. To better
understand the cost implications, we would like to request a detailed
*breakdown
of the LC-related fees* applicable to our account. Specifically, we would
like information on:

   1.

   *LC Issuance Fees* =E2=80=93 Charges for opening a new LC.
   2.

   *Commitment Fees* =E2=80=93 Any fees associated with maintaining an LC f=
acility.
   3.

   *Amendment Fees* =E2=80=93 Costs involved in modifying an existing LC.
   4.

   *Confirmation Fees* =E2=80=93 If applicable, fees for confirming the LC =
with
   another bank.
   5.

   *Any Other Applicable Charges* related to document processing,
   negotiation, or early payment.

We would appreciate it if you could provide the *fee structure, applicable
rates, and any terms or conditions* associated with LC issuance under our
loan account. If necessary, we are available to discuss this further at
your convenience.

Looking forward to your prompt response. Please feel free to reach out to
