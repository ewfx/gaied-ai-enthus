Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

I hope you're having a good day. I'm writing on behalf of XYZ Industries Pvt. Ltd. about closing our loan account (#987654321) with ABC Bank. We're planning to complete this by December 5, 2025, and would appreciate your help with the process.

Here's what we need to know:

• What's our current outstanding balance?
• What pre-closure charges will apply?
• What's the reallocation fee breakdown?
• What documents do we need to prepare?
• How long will the closure process take?
• When can we expect the Loan Closure Certificate and NDC?

For any questions or to discuss this further, please don't hesitate to reach out to:
