Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

I am writing to discuss potential modifications to my loan agreement with ABC Bank. My account number is 123456789, and the loan was issued on January 12, 2020. I am currently facing some financial challenges that are making it difficult to maintain my current payment schedule, and I would like to explore options for adjusting the terms of my loan.

I would appreciate your consideration of the following alternatives:

1. Loan Term Extension
   - This would help reduce my monthly payment burden by spreading the payments over a longer period
   - I am prepared to discuss various term extension options

2. Temporary Payment Reduction
   - A 10-month period of reduced monthly payments
   - After this period, I would resume regular payments
   - This would provide temporary relief while maintaining the overall loan structure

3. Interest Rate Adjustment
   - A review of the current interest rate
   - This could help make the payments more manageable

I want to emphasize that I am fully committed to meeting all my financial obligations. I am prepared to provide any necessary documentation to support my request, including:
- Current financial statements
- Income documentation
- Any other relevant paperwork

Please let me know:
1. The specific process for requesting these modifications
2. Any associated fees or charges
3. Additional information or documentation required
