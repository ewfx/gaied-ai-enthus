Dear [Commercial Lending Services Team],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to formally request an
adjustment to my existing loan [Loan Account Number: 123456789] issued by
ABC Bank on 01/12/2020. Due to unforeseen financial constraints, I am
facing difficulties in meeting the current repayment terms and would like
to explore possible adjustments to the loan structure.

I would appreciate it if you could consider one of the following options:

Extension of Loan Tenure - A longer repayment period to reduce the monthly
installment burden.
Temporary Reduction in EMI =E2=80=93 A revised EMI plan for the next 10 mon=
ths,
after which normal payments can resume.
Interest Rate Reassessment =E2=80=93 If applicable, a review of the interes=
t rate
to ease financial strain.
I assure you of my commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations and
would be happy to provide any necessary documents to support this request.
Please let me know the required process, applicable charges, and any
further information needed for consideration.

Looking forward to your response at your earliest convenience. You may
contact me at +123456789 or john.doe@sdfj.com.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
John Doe
