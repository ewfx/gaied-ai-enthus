Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

Subject: Friendly Request for Loan Fee Information
Account: New Facility

I hope this email finds you well! I'm writing from TechVision Solutions Ltd. regarding the ongoing fees for our proposed loan facility.

We're looking to understand the regular charges we'll need to budget for. Could you please help us with:

1. What are the regular administrative fees?
2. How much are the annual maintenance charges?
3. What commitment and renewal fees should we expect?
4. Are there any other regular service costs?
5. How often are these fees charged?

Your guidance would be much appreciated!

Best regards,
Rachel Wong
