Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

I am writing regarding my loan account (#123456789) with ABC Bank, which was issued on January 12, 2020. Due to recent financial challenges, I am experiencing difficulties in maintaining my current payment schedule and would like to explore options for adjusting the loan terms.

I would appreciate your consideration of the following alternatives:

1. Loan Term Extension
   - Current Situation: Monthly payments are currently too high
   - Proposed Solution: Extend the loan term to reduce monthly burden
   - Benefits: More manageable payments while maintaining commitment to full repayment

2. Temporary EMI Reduction
   - Duration: 10-month period
   - Structure: Reduced monthly payments followed by standard schedule
   - Purpose: Short-term financial relief while maintaining long-term commitment

3. Interest Rate Review
   - Current Need: More manageable payment structure
   - Request: Review of current interest rate
   - Goal: Better alignment with current financial situation

Documentation Support:
I am prepared to provide:
- Current financial statements
- Income verification documents
- Any additional required paperwork

Next Steps:
Please advise on:
1. Required application procedures
2. Associated fees and charges
3. Additional information needed
