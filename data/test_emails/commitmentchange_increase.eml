Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

I hope you are doing well. I am writing on behalf of *XYZ Industries Pvt.
Ltd.* to formally request a modification in the loan commitment for our
account *[Loan Account Number: 987654321]* with *ABC Bank*.

Due to evolving business needs and long-term financial planning, we would
like to extend our current loan tenure by an additional *5* beyond the
originally agreed term. This adjustment will allow us to maintain stable
cash flows while continuing our ongoing expansion and investment projects.

We would appreciate your guidance on the following:

   1.

   *Revised repayment schedule* and updated terms based on the proposed
   extension.
   2.

   *Potential changes in interest rates or other charges* due to the
   extended tenure.
   3.

   *Required documentation and approval process* to formalize the
   commitment change.
   4.

   Any other *regulatory or procedural requirements* that need to be
   addressed.

Please let us know the necessary steps to proceed with this request. We are
available to discuss this further at your convenience. For any
clarifications, you may reach me at *+91 98765 43210* or
*finance@xyzindustries.com*.

Looking forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
*Rahul Mehta*
