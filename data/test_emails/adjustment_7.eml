Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing about my loan account (#123456789) that I took out with ABC Bank back in January 2020. I've recently run into some financial challenges that are making it difficult to keep up with my current payment schedule.

I was wondering if we could discuss some options to help make my payments more manageable. Here are a few ideas I'd like to explore:

1. Stretching out the loan term to lower my monthly payments
2. Setting up a temporary reduced payment plan for the next 10 months
3. Looking into whether we could adjust the interest rate

I want to make sure you know that I'm fully committed to paying back the loan - I just need a bit of flexibility right now. I can provide any paperwork you need to support my request.

Could you please let me know:
- What steps I need to take
- If there are any fees involved
- What other information you might need

You can reach me at:

Thanks so much for your help with this.
