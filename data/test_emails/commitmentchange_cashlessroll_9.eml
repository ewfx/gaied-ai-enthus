Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

Reference: Account #109876543

I am writing on behalf of Cloud Systems Pvt. Ltd., a valued corporate client of ABC Bank. Our loan account (#109876543) was initially established to support our company's expansion initiatives.

We are currently evaluating options to modify our loan commitment terms and are particularly interested in the cashless roll facility. To proceed effectively, we require information on the following:

1. Commitment Modification Process
   • Required documentation
   • Processing timeline
   • Associated fees and charges
   • Impact on existing terms
   • Additional requirements

2. Cashless Roll Facility
   • Eligibility criteria
   • Terms and conditions
   • Implementation process
   • Associated costs
   • Timeline for implementation

3. Required Approvals
   • Internal authorization requirements
   • External documentation needs
   • Timeline for approvals
   • Key stakeholders involved
   • Additional compliance requirements

We would appreciate your guidance on these matters and are available for a detailed discussion if required.
