Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

I hope this message finds you well. As a loyal customer of ABC Bank for many years, I have greatly appreciated the excellent banking services and support provided by your institution. With my lending accounts (Account #234567890) approaching their maturity, I am writing to begin the closure process.

To ensure a smooth closure, I would appreciate information regarding:

1. Documentation Requirements
   • What forms need to be completed?
   • What supporting documents are required?
   • Are there any specific authentication procedures?

2. Timeline Expectations
   • How long will the closure process take?
   • When can I expect the final settlement?
   • What is the timeline for receiving the No Dues Certificate?

3. Principal Reallocation Options
   • What reinvestment options are available?
   • What transfer possibilities exist?
   • What are the associated terms and conditions?

Please provide these details at your earliest convenience. For any clarification or additional information, please contact:
