Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

Subject: Friendly Request for Loan Extension
Account: #678901234

I hope this email finds you well! I'm writing from TechVision Solutions Ltd. regarding our loan account (#678901234) with ABC Bank.

We're looking to extend our loan tenure by 5 years to better align with our business growth plans. Could you please help us with:

1. What documents we need to submit?
2. How long will the process take?
3. What changes can we expect in our EMI?
4. Are there any additional charges?
5. What approvals do we need?

Your guidance would be much appreciated!

Best regards,
Rachel Wong
