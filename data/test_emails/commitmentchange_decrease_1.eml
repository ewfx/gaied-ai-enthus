Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

Subject: Loan Commitment Reduction Request
Reference: Account #123456789

I am writing on behalf of Global Tech Solutions Ltd., a valued corporate client of ABC Bank. Our loan account (#123456789) was initially established to support our company's growth initiatives.

Due to our improved financial position and enhanced cash flow, we are seeking to reduce our loan commitment and explore early closure options. To proceed effectively, we require information on the following:

1. Loan Tenure Reduction
   • Process requirements
   • Feasibility assessment
   • Timeline expectations
   • Associated costs

2. Prepayment Options
   • Available options
   • Terms and conditions
   • Implementation process
   • Associated charges

3. Financial Implications
   • Impact on interest rates
   • Early closure charges
   • Cost-benefit analysis
   • Timeline considerations

4. Documentation Requirements
   • Required forms
   • Supporting documents
   • Approval process
   • Timeline expectations

We would appreciate your guidance on these matters and are available for a detailed discussion if required.
