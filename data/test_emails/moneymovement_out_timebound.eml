Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

I hope you are doing well. I am writing on behalf of XYZ Industries Pvt.
Ltd. to formally inform you of our decision to temporarily reallocate a
portion of our corporate funds currently held with ABC Bank.

Due to our strategic expansion plans and investment diversification, we
have decided to move =E2=82=B950 crores to other financial instruments and
international markets for the next two years. This decision is driven by:

Expansion into international markets, requiring liquidity for operational
setup in the USA and Europe.
Higher-yield investment opportunities, ensuring better financial growth.
Risk management, to diversify our capital holdings across multiple
financial institutions.
We want to ensure this transition is conducted smoothly, complying with all
necessary banking regulations. Kindly confirm the following:

Formalities and documentation required to process the fund movement.
Any applicable fees or penalties associated with large fund withdrawals.
Expected timeline for fund release and confirmation of successful
transactions.
Please advise on the next steps at your earliest convenience. If necessary,
we are happy to schedule a discussion to facilitate this process. For any
further clarifications, please contact me at +91 98765 43210 or
finance@xyzindustries.com.

We appreciate your support and cooperation in this matter.

Best regards,
Rahul Mehta
