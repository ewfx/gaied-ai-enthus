Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

I hope you're having a good day. I'm writing about my lending accounts with ABC Bank that I'd like to close. As a long-time customer, I've really appreciated your services, and now I need help with the closure process.

Here's what I need to know:

• What documents do I need to prepare?
• How long will the closure process take?
• What fees are involved in the process?
• When can I expect the No Dues Certificate?

For any questions or to discuss this further, please don't hesitate to reach out to:
