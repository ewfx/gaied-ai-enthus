Loan Account [987654321]

Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

I hope you are doing well. I am reaching out on behalf of *XYZ Industries
Pvt. Ltd.*, an existing corporate customer with *ABC Bank*, regarding our
loan account *[987654321]*, which was originally secured for investment in
our company's growth.

Given our *strong financial position* and improved cash flow, we are now
exploring options to *reduce the loan tenure*and close the loan earlier
than initially planned. We would like to understand the available options
for adjusting our commitment to facilitate an accelerated repayment.

Specifically, we would appreciate your guidance on:

   1.

   *Process and feasibility* of reducing the loan tenure.
   2.

   *Any prepayment options* that allow us to close the loan earlier.
   3.

   *Potential impact on interest rates and associated charges* for an early
   closure.
   4.

   *Documentation and approval requirements* for making this adjustment.

Please provide details at your earliest convenience so we can proceed
accordingly. If required, we are happy to schedule a discussion to review
the available options.

Looking forward to your response. You can reach me at *+91 98765 43210* or
via email at *finance@xyzindustries.com*.

Best regards,
*Rahul Mehta*
