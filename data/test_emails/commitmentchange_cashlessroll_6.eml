Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

I hope you're having a good day. I'm writing about our loan account (#432109876) with ABC Bank. As a long-time customer, TechVision Solutions Ltd. is looking to make some changes to our loan commitment and explore the cashless roll option.

Here's what we need to know:

• What documents do we need to prepare for modifying the loan commitment?
• How long will the process take?
• What are the costs involved?
• What are the terms for the cashless roll facility?
• What approvals do we need?

For any questions or to discuss this further, please don't hesitate to reach out to:

Rachel Wong
