Dear Commercial Lending Services Team,

I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out regarding my loan account [123456789] that I obtained from ABC Bank on January 12, 2020. I am currently experiencing some financial challenges that are making it difficult to maintain my current payment schedule.

I would be grateful if you could consider the following options to help me manage my situation better:

• Extending the loan term to reduce my monthly payment burden
• Implementing a temporary payment reduction plan for the next 10 months
• Reviewing the possibility of adjusting the interest rate

I want to emphasize my strong commitment to fulfilling all my financial obligations. I am ready to provide any documentation needed to support my request. Could you please let me know what steps I need to take, including any fees that might be involved?

I would greatly appreciate your prompt attention to this matter. You can contact me at:
