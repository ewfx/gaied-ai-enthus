I am writing to request a modification to my loan terms with ABC Bank (issued 01/12/2020). Due to current financial constraints, I need to explore options for adjusting my repayment schedule.

Requested Modifications:
1. Loan term extension
2. 10-month temporary EMI reduction
3. Interest rate review

I am committed to meeting all financial obligations and can provide supporting documentation as needed. Please advise on required procedures and associated costs.
